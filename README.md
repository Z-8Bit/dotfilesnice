Linux configuration files by Nathaniel Evan. Inspired by various sources.
As seen on [this r/unixporn post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/mewpsp/dwm_still_lovin_nord/)

Check out my personal suckless builds:
* [dwm](https://github.com/nathanielevan/dwm)
* [dmenu](https://github.com/nathanielevan/dmenu)
* [st](https://github.com/nathanielevan/st)
* [slock](https://github.com/nathanielevan/slock)

## Notes
* These configuration files assume that the target system is running Arch Linux.
* Does not include system-wide configurations, e.g. systemd power management config (which I use in my machine)

## WIP:
* Personal bootstrapping script, if I ever feel like it.
* Finish configuring tmux.
* Experiment with awesomewm, ~~bspwm~~ and/or ~~dwm~~/xmonad, when I'm in the mood to break things.

Suggestions and pull requests welcome, and if I accept yours, I'll credit you in this README and in the corresponding merge commit.
