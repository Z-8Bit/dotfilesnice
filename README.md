Linux configuration files by (Nathaniel Evan)[https://github.com/nathanielevan/dotfiles], modified by Zishaan.

## Notes
* These configuration files assume that the target system is running Arch Linux.
* Does not include system-wide configurations, e.g. systemd power management config (which I use in my machine)

## WIP:
* Personal bootstrapping script, if I ever feel like it.
* Finish configuring tmux.
* Experiment with awesomewm, ~~bspwm~~, ~~dwm~~/xmonad, and/or ~~openbox~~ when I'm in the mood to break things.

Suggestions and pull requests welcome, and if I accept yours, I'll credit you in this README and in the corresponding merge commit.
