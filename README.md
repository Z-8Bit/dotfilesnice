Linux configuration files by [Nathaniel Evan](https://github.com/nathanielevan/dotfiles), modified by Zishaan.

## Notes
* These configuration files assume that the target system is running Arch Linux.
* Does not include system-wide configurations, e.g. systemd power management config (which I use in my machine)

Suggestions and pull requests welcome, and if I accept yours, I'll credit you in this README and in the corresponding merge commit.
